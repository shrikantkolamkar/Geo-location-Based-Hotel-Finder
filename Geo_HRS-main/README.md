# Pune Hotel Recommendation engine
Project Pune Hotel Recommendation engine using Python and Streamlit is an application that allows users to find the closest 10 hotels to a given location in Pune. 
The application uses Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications, to create a simple and intuitive user interface. 
The application takes in the user's desired location as an input and uses a combination of web scraping and geolocation technologies to identify the closest 10 hotels to the location. 
The application then displays these hotels on a map with the user's location at the center.  
The application is designed to help travelers quickly and easily find the best hotels in Pune.
